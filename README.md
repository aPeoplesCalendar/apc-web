A People's Calendar (aPC) is a project that seeks to promote the worldwide history of working class movements and liberation struggles in the form of a searchable "On This Day" style calendar.

This repository hosts the aPC web app, built with React w/ TypeScript. The website integrates with a backend built in SupabaseJS. For credentials necessary to run the app locally, see the `.env.example` file. Please reach out to the repo owner to get valid, current credentials if you need them.

This project is open source and the information contained in our event database is non-proprietary and will *always* be freely available for users, developers, and the public.

> TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.

> What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.

> And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.

- Howard Zinn (1922 - 2010)
